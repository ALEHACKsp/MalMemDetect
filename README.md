# MalMemDetect
Detect strange memory regions and DLLs


Compile as a DLL and inject into a process to identify hollowed DLLs and unmapped memory region calls.


Sleep hook seems to break a few things so I left it in but commented, as well as a few other things that are left more as "Demos" and commented out.


Results by default will output to a file in C:\ drive.
